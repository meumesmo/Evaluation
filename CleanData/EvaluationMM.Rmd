## Content

The evaluation of the courses in MetaMath and MathGeAr projects focused in assessing the performance of the students from the participant universities.

## Participant Students

Aproximately 2000 students completed the assessment during the years of the projects. 

## The Assessment

Each university developed their own performance test for each course. 

## MetaMath Universities

### OMSU

```{r cars}
summary(DataOMSU)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
